    Welcome to Course Experiences, a site where students can share their experiences and feedback of UQ courses so
    new students can see which courses are worth taking.
</p>
<p>
    The goal of this site is to hopefully inform students whether the courses they are considering are interesting,
    educational or probably not worth it for them.
</p>
